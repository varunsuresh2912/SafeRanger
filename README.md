# SafeRanger
A semi-autonomous miniature multispectral diagnostic Bluetooth controlled tank based rover which can monitor heating of valves using Thermal Camera and monitor gas leaks in oil and gas power plants.  The thermal data is sent to the control center through VNC, a Wi-Fi server with which alerts or guidance can be in turn provided to the technician, so that necessary steps can be taken.
